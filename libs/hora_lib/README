Changes in this update:

New Methods Added:

node_search_k_with_filter: search for k nearest neighbors node internal method. We have added a new method with an additional filter parameter. This parameter is a very fast bitmap that can be used to filter during the query process, achieving the fusion of vector retrieval and scalar retrieval.
